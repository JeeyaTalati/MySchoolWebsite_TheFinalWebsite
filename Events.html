        --> Camp
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Camps are regularly organised in order to encourage ‘Team Building’ spirit among the teens
             of the school, keeping in mind their critical age. The children are taught to pitch their
              tent and decorate it, cook their food and participate in various Camp activities. 
              At the same time, they are also instructed to be eco-friendly and avoid ‘Camp-Fires’
               in order to Save Fuel.

        <h2>
        --> Picnic
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Schooling is not only about studying but also about having fun. Education is best imparted, 
            if learning is made fun.  It is because of which we  encourage the active participation of
             students in picnics. These activities at school act as effective stress busters in the 
             hectic school schedule and also help create an environment that is conducive to the 
             general growth and development of young minds.
